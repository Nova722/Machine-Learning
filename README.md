# Machine-Learning

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

I developed multiple machine learning models in order to see which models were the most accurate.

Some models used scaled data others did not.
MinMaxScaler was used to scale the data.

Random forest models performed the best in terms of accuracy.
See "Models.PNG" for the various models used and the scores.
